# persisted_cache

This is a template kit (with */example*) to create a Flutter Package.

The template project is a great foundation for creating packages that uses with BLoC and Modular programming patterns.

The package also contains an ad-hoc */example* folder with an app designed to load the new package and quickly allow the developer to create a demo/POC/beta-sample.

**^^The */example* that creates an app is also a great foundation for an app beyond development and proof-of-concept(POC)**

**Code Generation** Is a key aspect of this package

## Setup

### Changes to content of template

- After un-ziping, rename the folder from _template_package to "new name"

- Rename 'lib/*persisted_cache.dart*' to the "new package name" (eg custom_widget_package.dart)

- Open the project in IDE of choice and search/replace "*persisted_cache*" with "new package name". This 100% works using VSCode.

- Search/Replace '*icodeforyou.cache*' with project/company domain.

#### NOTE

***icodeforyou.cache** will be part of the reverse domain used by XCode and Android in the app/product name. Choose carefully!*

### **Important**: Make these ***Setup*** changes your initial comment to version control before proceeding
